# What is this ?
This project is a alice style (since it has arrow keys its an arisu) 54 percent keyboard. Layout is most likely final because i don't really feel like changing it.

# Changes I would like to make in another revision
Throughout the design process of making a keyboard i find things that I find that would make things easier or would be cool feature. However it would be difficult to impliment half-way through a project. Here are some of the things i would like to implement

* Duplex matrix, [See here](https://wiki.ai03.com/uploads/images/gallery/2018-01-Jan/scaled-840-0/275-iogqtki-7-scuakyhwdw.png)
    
    Something I saw on ai03's keyboard guide, it seemed interesting and a neat little challenge, also uses less pins and makes routing to the mcu easier while making routing the matrix harder. This would require me to also code a custom algorithm for scanning.

* Internally split keyboard
    
    To have two seperate pcbs mounted on the inside of the keyboard, allowing for a softer typing experience, perhaps a daughter board that connects both boards and is the usb ports.
        
* Flex cuts
    
   Although Im not too confident in the flex cuts being needed some small flex cuts would be nice. This could compliment the stiffness of some stiffer materials I plan to use on the plate
